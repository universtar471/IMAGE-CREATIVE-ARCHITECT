# Architecture Decisions

Use this file as a lightweight ADR log.

## ADR-001 — Structured DNA is canonical
Status: accepted

Prompt text is derived from structured project data. Provider-specific prompts must never become the only representation of project intent.

## ADR-002 — Provider-neutral core
Status: accepted

Domain data cannot depend on Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, FLUX, Stability, Topaz or browser UI structures.

## ADR-003 — Local-first Phase 1
Status: accepted

Phase 1 uses local SQLite + managed local files. Cloud synchronization is deferred.

## ADR-004 — Original image immutability
Status: accepted

Imported originals are copied into managed storage and never overwritten by edits/upscales. Derived results create new assets with lineage.

## ADR-005 — Zod schema source of truth
Status: proposed/accepted unless implementation finds a blocker

Use Zod for runtime domain validation and inferred TypeScript types. Future JSON Schema for AI structured outputs should derive from the same model where feasible.

## ADR-006 — Browser automation deferred
Status: accepted

Browser automation is an optional future provider adapter, not the core architecture.

## ADR-007 — UI/UX shell is Phase 1 architecture
Status: accepted

The Project Hub, stable Project Workspace, reusable center canvas, contextual right properties panel and bottom production tray are implemented before provider integration.

Reason:
Future Camera, Lighting, Mood, Generate, Enhance and QC modules must plug into a stable interaction architecture without forcing a navigation/workspace redesign.

Phase 1 builds structural UX only. Final visual polish and advanced interactions are deferred.
